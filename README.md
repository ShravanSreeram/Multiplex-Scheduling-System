# Multiplex-Scheduling-System
A Multiplex Scheduling algorithm to maximize profit in a multiplex movie theatre under given constraints


Constraints :


 If the success rate of the movie goes below 60 % number of shows/screens need to be reduced. 
 
 If the success rate goes below 30 % movie is likely to be removed. This empties slots for movies with higher success, which increases our revenue
 
 If the movie is running for more than a week, its priority should be reduced , to pave way for the newly releasing movies

There should be no empty screens

 No two adjacent screens should start a show at the same time since that could lead to overcrowding
